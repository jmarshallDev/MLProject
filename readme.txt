Install nltk with whatever of these works for you:
pip install nltk
pip3 install nltk
Once you've installed nltk, import it and run the following (you only have to do this once):
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
