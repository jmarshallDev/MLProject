# ML Project

#### A Small Update:
##### I've almost finished writing the preprocessing functions; I'm just dealing with numpy being annoying when I want to use it with other libraries. The goal is to make it plug-and-play, so you guys can just import the class and have the data ready to go. Just mentioning this so you don't spend loads of time on something that (hopefully) I can do. I'll upload the incomplete code if I get really stuck, but it's looking like I'll have it finished some time tomorrow (?). -Nicklaus
